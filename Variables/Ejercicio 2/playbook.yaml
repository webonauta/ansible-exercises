#Ansible Variables
#We have added a new task to disable SNMP port in the playbook. However the port is hardcoded in the playbook. 
#Update the inventory file to add a new variable snmp_port and assign the value used here. Then update the playbook 
#to use value from the variable.

#Remember to use curly braces around the variable name.
