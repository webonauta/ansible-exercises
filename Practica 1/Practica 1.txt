Note: Use the description below to name the plays and tasks.

Stop the web services on web server nodes - service httpd stop
Shutdown the database services on db server nodes - service mysql stop
Restart all servers (web and db) at once - /sbin/shutdown -r
Start the database services on db server nodes - service mysql start
Start the web services on web server nodes - service httpd start

Warning: Do not use this playbook in a real setup. There are better ways to do these actions. This is only for simple practise.
